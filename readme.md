A WordPress plugin for Open Hour.

## Description

This plugin displays open hour table on single page.

### How to display

You can use shortcode `[open-hour]` for it. If you are a theme developer,
just use `tsoh_the_timetable()` function.

This plugin is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/tarosky/taro-open-hour/), any Pull Requests are welcomed!

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/taro-open-hour` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
1. Go to `Setting > Open Hour` and set it up.

## Customization

Here is a list of customizations.

### Change Style

If you have `tsoh-style.css` in your theme folder, it will be used.
Child theme supported.

We also have filter hook `tsoh_stylesheet`. Below is the example to change css url.

```
<?php
// Change css path.
add_filter('tsoh_stylesheet', function($style){
    $style = [
        'url'     => get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/assets/css/table.css',
        'version' => wp_get_theme()->get('Version'),
    ];
    return $style;
});
```

If you returns `false` on filter hook, no style will be loaded.

### Change table markup

Table's template is located at `taro-open-hour/templates/time-table.php`.
Copy it to `your-theme/template-part/tsoh/time-table.php ` and change markups.

Of course, you can change template path with filter hook.

```
// e.g. If post type is event, change template from default.
add_filter( 'tsoh_timetable_template_path', function( $path, $post ) {
    if ( 'event' == $post->post_type ) {
        $path = get_template_directory() . '/templates/yours/event.php';
    }
    return $path;
}, 10, 2 );
```
